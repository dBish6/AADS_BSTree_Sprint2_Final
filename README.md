# AADS_BSTree_Sprint2_Final
This is the individual part of my very last sprint project from my Solfware Development Course at Keyin Collage, Semester 4 2022.

This project uses a AVLtree and you can interact with the tree by running a CLI by using the list of options show by the CLI.
e.g:
1. Insert Node
2. Delete a Node
3. Get Balance Factor
And so on...
