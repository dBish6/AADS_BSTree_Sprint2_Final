# AADS_BSTree_Sprint2_Final
__This respository is now archived__ - the project has moved to https://github.com/dBish6/class-work/tree/master/Semester4/AADS_S4_BSTree_Sprint_Final.

This is the individual part of my very last sprint project from my Solfware Development Course at Keyin Collage, Semester 4 2022.

This project uses a AVLtree and you can interact with the tree by running a CLI by using the list of options show by the CLI.
e.g:
1. Insert Node
2. Delete a Node
3. Get Balance Factor
And so on...
